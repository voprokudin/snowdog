# Snowdog Android Recruitment test

### We are glad that you've joined SNOW.DOG recruitment process. Below is task for you, good luck!

1. Fork this repo to your github.
2. The repository contains app resources: icons, color palette, layouts, fragments and activities. You can use whatever library, design patterns and dependency injection you want. You can add and modify all the things you want, just show us that you know Android :)
3. Your task is to create an app on top of this project:
	1. Your main goal is to provide data
    	* download items from [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com):
          1. Download photos from the endpoint [`/photos`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos). There are 5000 items, shrink the list to 100 using request parameter (`_limit=100`). You can use `RawPhoto` model.
          2. Download albums from the endpoint [`/albums/{id}`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/2) for `ids` that are in the downloaded photos (field: `albumId`). You can use `RawAlbum` model.
          3. Download users from the endpoint [`/users/{id}`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/3) for `ids` that are in the downloaded albums (field: `userId`). You can use `RawUser` model.
        * Download all the items on `SplashActivity`. The rest of the app should use cached data. If there are some problems with connection, display a dialog. You can use `showError()` in `SplashActivity`
        * Display a list with thumbnails on `RecyclerView` in `ListFragment`. You can use `ListItem` model and `ListAdapter` but you can change it or use whatever adapter you want.
        * Display details with a full photo in `DetailFragment` which appears after clicking on an item on the list. You can use `Detail` model.
        * Use `R.id.search` to filter data by `title` and `albumTitle` in `RecyclerView`.
    2. Your second goal is to style the app:
    	* All the necessary colors are defined in `palette.xml`, use them to style your app.
        * Use `R.drawable.ic_placeholder` for placeholders in `ImageViews`.
    3. Optional - if you want more :)
		* In `mock` flavor there are mocks for all requests that you can use while developing. You can finish mock flavor.
        * Use `R.id.banner` to show users if they are in offline mode. The app should start from scratch in offline mode for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, when the app starts, show a dialog using `showError()` in `SplashActivity`. 
        * Create dark mode for the app. All the variants of logos are also defined in dark mode.
        * Try to create some animations/transitions.
        * Polish your app, try to add something that will blow our minds :)
4. Remember to commit as much as you can. Don't be afraid of mess in your commits, we will not look at your commit history :)
5. Once you've completed the task, please **send us the link to your repo**. We would also be grateful for your **feedback** for this task. Feel free to send us your ideas about it, maybe we can improve it for future candidates.

### Tips:
* jsonplaceholder uses [`placeholder.com`](https://placeholder.com) which returns error 410 on Android devices. You need to change `User-agent` header of requests (to `Cool app` or something different than default).
* jsonplaceholder response may took even one minute. Instead of increasing timeouts, try to retry requests few times. On second/third request it usually works fine.
* If you want to use your http client to cache data, be aware of `Pragma` and `Age` headers.
